			<h4>Lesson #1: </h4>
			Type something here:
			<div class="m_input">
				<input class="form-control" type="text" aria-label="Default" aria-describedby="inputGroup-sizing-default" v-model="name">
			</div>

			<h4>-- If entered name is "Stas" then display "True" - else display "False"</h4>
			<h3 class="positive_result positive_negative_result_shadow" v-if="name == 'Stas'">True</h3>
			<h3 class="negative_result positive_negative_result_shadow" v-else>False</h3>
			<hr>


			<h4>Lesson #2: </h4>
			<p>Please type "Jeff Kaplan" or "Leeroy Jenkins" in a name field located above to see one of two additional articles</p>
			<template v-if="name == 'Leeroy Jenkins'">
				<div class="sample inner_sample">
					<p class="name_of_a_person name_of_a_person_shadow">Leeroy Jenkins</p>
					<p>Forty-three million YouTube hits later, the legendary World of Warcraft meme Leeroy Jenkins is now 10 years old.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The meme evolved from a video of a group of WoW players planning a raid when one player, known as Leeroy Jenkins, went rogue and spoiled the raid. The video, uploaded in May 2005, went viral before “going viral” was really even a thing. It was alluded to on TV shows including My Name is Earl and in movies like Wreck-it-Ralph. There were spinoffs on YouTube and a hit on South Park.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						And yet, one question remains—was the whole thing staged?
						<br/>
						<br/>
						According to the real-life Leeroy, Ben Schultz, it’s up to the viewer to decide.

					<p class="name_of_a_person name_of_a_person_shadow">Jeffrey Kaplan</p>
					<p>Jeffrey Kaplan is an American video game designer who is vice president of Blizzard Entertainment.
						<br/>
						He designed elements of World of Warcraft and is the lead designer on Overwatch.
						Kaplan became involved in the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) Everquest. Under his online handle "Tigole", he joined the "Legacy of Steel" guild,
						as well as became a well-recognized player for his accomplishments and his commentary about the game posted to the guild's website.
						He discussed some of his map making attempts which caught the attention of the guild's leader, Rob Pardo, who at the time was the lead designer at
						Blizzard for Warcraft III; Kaplan was aware that some of his guild members worked at Blizzard, but he had not recognized the importance of the company
						at that point. Around 2001, Pardo invited Kaplan to come visit Blizzard's offices in Los Angeles, during which he was introduced to several other Blizzard
						guild members, and they showed him the yet-unannounced MMO World of Warcraft (WoW) project they had been working on. Several similar meetings happened
						over the next few months. Later, after World of Warcraft was announced, Pardo suggested that Kaplan apply for a recently-posted job for a WoW quest
						designer there; Kaplan realized that the job description was tailor-made for his background, and that his previous visit to Blizzard had been an informal
						job interview. Kaplan applied and was hired into Blizzard by May 2002.
						On 2017, Kaplan was awarded with the Vanguard Award at the Fun & Serious Game Festival, which takes place in the Spanish city of Bilbao.
